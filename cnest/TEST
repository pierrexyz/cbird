NUMERICAL CONVERGENCE TESTS (03/2019)


GENERAL COMMENT:

Requirement on sub-permill precision achieved.

The IR-resummation presents potential (sub-permill) errors
if applied on the full signal.
There should be no numerical convergence issue 
once applied only to the `non-smoothed' residual.
(Percentage difference quoted on the resummed SPT power spectrum 
monopole, with b2, b3 -> b1 -> 2, others -> 0)


CRITICAL: 

Resummation integration relative error critirion:
eps = 1e-3 -> 1e-4 ~ 0.1%
eps = 1e-4 -> 1e-5 < 0.01%
CHOICE: eps = 1e-4
- gsl GAUSS61 integrator is retained.

Min value of kp array in FFTLog resummation matrices:
kpmin = 1e-3 -> 1e-1: < 0.2% (k ~ 0.3)
CHOICE: kpmin = 1e-3
- Better periodic boundaries, however potential leakage of ringing?

Resummation cutoff:
LambdaIR = 0.6 -> 1.0: < 0.3%
LambdaIR = 1.0 -> 1.2 < 0.5% (damping starting from k ~ 0.2 for 1.2)
CHOICE: LambdaIR = 0.066
- Safe (conservative) choice to avoid damping.


PASSED:

FFTLog linear power spectrum decomposition: 
NFFT = 512, kmaxFFT = 100 vs.
NFFT = 256, kmaxFFT = 20: < 0.01%
NFFT = 128, kmaxFFT = 20: < 0.1%
NFFT = 512, kmaxFFT = 2: ~ 1% (k ~ 0.5)
CHOICE: NFFT = 256, kmaxFFT = 20.

Number of points in FFTLog resummation matrices:
Nkp = 1024 -> 2048: < 0.2% (k ~ 0.5), 0.1% (k ~ 0.3)
Nkp = 2048 -> 4096: < 0.01%
CHOICE: Nkp = 2048

Float precision output:
default vs. 16 digits < 0.01%
CHOICE: default

In-code precision:
long double vs. double < 0.01%
CHOICE: double

Number of points nonresummed power spectrum (kmin = 0.01, kmax = 1):
Nk = 100 -> 200: < 0.01%
CHOICE: Nk = 100
- linear-spacing does a better job.

Number of points resummed power spectrum (kmin = 0.01, kmax = 0.5):
Nout = 50 -> 100: < 0.01%
CHOICE: Nout = 50

AP effect (nbinsmu = 100)
no AP vs. AP with (qpar = qperp = 1): < 0.01%

Multipoles l = 6, 8 in resummation sum / reconstruction before AP:
with vs. without: < 0.01%
