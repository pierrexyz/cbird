--- CBiRd ---
Code for Bias tracers in Redshift space
version 0.3 (earlyCBiRd - 28/01/2019)

by: Pierre Zhang


Introduction
------------
CBiRd provides correlators of bias tracers in redshift space (in the EFTofLSS):

1. CBiRd computes the multipoles l = 0, 2, 4, of the one-loop power spectrum described in
arXiv:1610.09321 using an FFTLog decomposition of the linear power spectrum and analytic 
evaluation of the loop integrals following arXiv:1708.08130. The multipoles are IR-resummed 
using controlled approximations identified in arXiv:1512.06831.

2. CBiRd computes the monopole of the tree-level bispectrum for arbitrary Alcock-Paczynski 
parameters.

More details on the implementation can be found in arXiv:1902.XXXXX.


Why earlyCBiRd?
---------------
Because CBiRd is not so fast (not fast enough for direct use in MCMC unlike e.g. CMBfast).
CBiRd is just a pilot attempt for efficient computation of EFTofLSS correlators.
Incidentally, CBiRd can provide an 'earlybird' pass to explore the cosmos with LSS surveys.


Requirements
------------
CBiRd is written in C++ with standard ISO C++11. 

Three libraries are required for compilation:
- the GSL library <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>
- the FFTW library <http://www.fftw.org/>
- the CUBA library (version 4.2) <http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/> 
- the Eigen library <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/> 
The code should be provided with the Eigen headers in the source: no installation should be 
required for the Eigen library.

The loop calculation involves a discrete Fourier transformation routine from the FFTW library
and the use of the Eigen library for efficient matrix multiplication.

The IR-resummation makes use of the FFTLog algorithm first written in Fortran by A. Hamilton: 
<http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog/>, then translated in C by J. Carlson within the
Copter library: <http://mwhite.berkeley.edu/Copter/>, which is released under the GNU General 
Public License, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>. 
The files 'fftlog.h' and 'fftlog.cpp' are from the Copter library. 

The bispectrum monopole projection is performed with the Cuhre routine of the CUBA library.


Compiling and running
---------------------
Adjust or include paths to the GSL, FFTW and CUBA libraries in Makefile, and run 'make'.

To run CBiRd type:
./cbird path/to/inifile

An example inifile can be found in ./input/CBiRd.ini .

Decent numerical precision on the linear power spectrum in input is highly recommended.
(default CAMB of CLASS numerical precision is somewhat loose for evaluation of the loop integrals.)


Output
------
CBiRd generates six files :
'PowerSpectraLinear_lX.dat' and 'PowerSpectra1loop_lX.dat' with X = 0,2,4 being the multipoles.

First line in the output files (with an '#' at the beginning) is the legend for the columns:
# k[h/Mpc]    bi    ... 
It means that the first column is the k's for which the power spectra in the other column are 
evaluated and 'bi' is the EFT coefficients multiplying the power spectra in the corresponding
column.


Performances
------------
Convergence:
earlyCBiRd has been tested against an even earlier version involving numerical evaluation of the
loop integrals. Otherwise, results of tests against high-fidelity HOD simulations can be found in
arXiv:1902.XXXXX.

Efficiency:
earlyCBiRd is not so fast because of computation of long-wavelength modulation matrices for the 
IR-resummation. In comparison evaluation of the loop integrals is pretty rapid. 
In current version the analytic results of the loop integrals are not stored. 
A shot noise subtraction tends to slow down significantly the evaluation.
