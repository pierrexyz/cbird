NUMERICAL CONVERGENCE TESTS (03/2019)


GENERAL COMMENT:
No major numerical flaw except apparition of spikes at some k 
for some cosmologies. The critical step was nailed down to the 
resummation convolution. Efforts were given to get rid of them.
The case seems solved at least for the total power spectrum.

(Percentage difference quoted on the resummed SPT power spectrum 
monopole, with b2, b3 -> b1 -> 2, others -> 0)


CRITICAL:

Resummation integration relative error critirion:
eps = 1e-3 -> 1e-4 ~ 1, 2, 3% (spikes)
eps = 1e-4 -> 1e-5 < 0.01%
CHOICE: eps = 1e-4
- To be kept, otherwise spikes appear.
- gsl GAUSS61 integrator is retained.

Min value of kp array in FFTLog resummation matrices:
kpmin = 1e-3 -> 1e-1: < 0.2% (k ~ 0.3)
CHOICE: kpmin = 1e-3
- Better periodic boundaries, however potential leakage of ringing.

Resummation cutoff:
LambdaIR = 0.6 -> 0.8: < 0.3% (not fully resummed for 0.6)
LambdaIR = 0.8 -> 1.0 < 0.2% (stable)
LambdaIR = 1.0 -> 1.2 < 0.5% (damping starting from k ~ 0.25 for 1.2)
CHOICE: LambdaIR = 0.8
- Safe (conservative) choice to avoid damping.


PASSED:

FFTLog linear power spectrum decomposition: 
NFFT = 512, kmaxFFT = 100 vs.
NFFT = 256, kmaxFFT = 20: < 0.01%
NFFT = 128, kmaxFFT = 20: < 0.1%
NFFT = 512, kmaxFFT = 2: ~ 1% (k ~ 0.5)
CHOICE: NFFT = 256, kmaxFFT = 20.

Number of points in FFTLog resummation matrices:
Nkp = 1024 -> 2048: < 0.2% (k ~ 0.5), 0.1% (k ~ 0.3)
Nkp = 2048 -> 4096: < 0.01%
CHOICE: Nkp = 2048

Float precision output:
default vs. 16 digits < 0.01%
CHOICE: default

In-code precision:
long double vs. double < 0.01%
CHOICE: double

Number of points nonresummed power spectrum (kmin = 0.01, kmax = 1):
Nk = 100 -> 200: < 0.01%
CHOICE: Nk = 100
- linear-spacing does a better job.

Number of points resummed power spectrum (kmin = 0.01, kmax = 0.5):
Nout = 50 -> 100: < 0.01%
CHOICE: Nout = 50

AP effect (nbinsmu = 100)
no AP vs. AP (qpar = qperp = 1): < 0.01%

Multipoles l = 6, 8 in resummation sum / reconstruction before AP:
with vs. without: < 0.01%
